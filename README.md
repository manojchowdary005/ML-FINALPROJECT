HEART DISEASE PREDICTION USING ML

To predictÂ the presence of cardiac disease in a patient, we have used a number of Machine Learning algorithms that were developed in Python. This classification issue predicts whether or not heart disease is present by using a range of characteristics as input features and a binary variable as the target variable.

Machine Learning algorithms used here are:

Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
Random Forest (Scikit-learn)

Accuracy achieved: 95% (Random Forest)
